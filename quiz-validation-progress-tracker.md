## 🔄 Task 5.2 Analysis (Week 4 종합 퀴즈 검증 - Day 27)

**Started**: January 13, 2026  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress - Critical Issue Identified  
**File**: week4/day27/quiz.md

### 🔴 Critical Issue Identified:

**Problem**: The current Day 27 file is **NOT a quiz** but rather a comprehensive study checklist and review material.

**Current Content**:
- Study checklist format with checkboxes
- Review materials and concepts
- 10 sample questions at the end (not 15 required)
- Study strategies and exam preparation tips
- No proper quiz structure

**Required Format** (per requirements 7.1-7.5):
- ✅ **15 questions** (currently has only 10 sample questions)
- ✅ **5 options each** (A, B, C, D, E) (current sample questions have 4 options)
- ✅ **4-5 multiple answer questions** (30%) (current sample questions are single answer)
- ✅ **Proper quiz format** with detail tags
- ✅ **Comprehensive quiz structure** like Days 7, 14, 21

### 📋 Validation Results:

**❌ 15문항 구성 확인**: FAILED - Only 10 sample questions found, not 15 proper quiz questions
**❌ 5개 선택지 (A, B, C, D, E) 구조 확인**: FAILED - Sample questions have only 4 options (A, B, C, D)
**❌ 복수 정답 문항이 4-5개 (30%)인지 확인**: FAILED - All sample questions are single answer
**❌ 복수 정답 표기 형식 검증**: FAILED - No multiple answer format present
**❌ 복수 정답 해설의 완성도 점검**: FAILED - No multiple answer explanations

### 🚨 Action Required:

This file requires **major restructuring** to convert from a study checklist to a proper comprehensive quiz format. The current content should be:

1. **Preserved as study material** (possibly moved to a separate study guide file)
2. **Replaced with a proper 15-question comprehensive quiz** following the format of Days 7, 14, and 21
3. **Structured with 5 options per question** (A, B, C, D, E)
4. **Include 4-5 multiple answer questions** (30% of 15 questions)
5. **Apply detail tags** to hide answers initially

### 🎯 Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Create a proper quiz structure** based on the study material content
2. **Convert key concepts into 15 comprehensive questions**
3. **Ensure 4-5 questions have multiple correct answers**
4. **Apply consistent formatting** with other weekly comprehensive quizzes
5. **Preserve the valuable study content** in an appropriate location

**Task 5.2 Status**: 🔄 Critical Issue Identified - Major Restructuring Required

**Document Updated**: January 13, 2026
